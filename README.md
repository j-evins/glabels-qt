## What's new in gLabels-qt?

- Based on the Qt cross-platform framework.
- Unlike previous versions, glabels-qt is a cross-platform application.  So far, it
  has been built and tested under both Linux and Windows 7 (using MSYS/MINGW toolchain).
- Updated UI based on typical workflows.

It is still missing several features to bring it in parity with glabels-3.4.  These include

- Barcode objects
- Compatability with older glabels files
- Batch mode
- Internationalization
- Custom product templates designer
- Online manual
