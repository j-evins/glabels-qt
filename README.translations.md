## Translation management

We manage all translations within a [Zanata Project](https://translate.zanata.org/project/view/Glabels). Please don't send your files via Github, use only Zanata.

Sign in to change your translation file. You can find some instructions in the [Translator Guide](http://docs.zanata.org/en/release/user-guide/translator-guide/). If you can't find your desired language, please contact Mario Bl√§ttermann <mario.blaettermann@gmail.com>.


## Previous translations

Current translations have been exported from the previous versions of [Glabels 3.x](https://l10n.gnome.org/module/glabels/#glabels-3_4). Once we have a translatable user manual in Glabels-qt, we will also add the imported translations at Zanata (as long as an export from the current xml files makes sense).
